# Victory Chat
### Version 2

## [demo](http://chat.plzz.de/)

To run VC, first set up a CouchDB database with HTTP
Basic Auth enabled and set up a username and password (admin).

Because we are using HTTP Basic Auth, make sure CouchDB runs on
the localhost - anything else is a security issue.

Open up config.ini and replace all of the values
you need to change. Afterwards,
you can just run `python3 run.py`.

If anything doesn't work properly, please file an issue.
